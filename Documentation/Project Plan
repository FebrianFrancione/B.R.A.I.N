Artificial Intelligence:

Implement an A* search algorithm that will interact with front end in order to navigate through obstacles.

Machine Learning:

Ability to use a variety of classification to determine situations and emotions,
as well as predict a possible emotional reaction.
For sake of context, add CNN.

Networking:

Make different parts of brain act as "servers" that can communicate through data transfer with each other.

Documentation:
Add sequence diagram, class diagram, Use Cases

Front-End:
Use javascript and other frameworks - Node? Express? ReaCT/ANGULAR with mongoDB backend?
Make images of brain and create obstacles for it to navigate through. Offer visual representations of sections of brain
as they communicate.

Backend:
Networking parts of brain and connecting them to each other
